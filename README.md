#LeSean Johnson TMDB_Viewer for NAVIS.

This is my app built around the TMDB free API to search movies. This app uses the ReactJS framework for structure, Redux for state management, and Redux Sagas for Asynchronous actions.

##Running the application:
1. Navigate  to the desired location on your machine and cone the repo using: ```git clone https://github.com/leseanbiz/TMDB_Viewer.git```
2. Then run ```yarn``` with in the new directory.
3. Running ```yarn start``` should start the application in the default browser at ```localhost.com/3000```

##Notes on development
During the development of this app the API from TMDB has had some issues. Nevertheless when it restabilizes all should function as expected.

Notes on down time with reasons can be found here: [Link](https://twitter.com/themoviedb)

##Functionality
On load the app should focus on the search bar and searches are triggered with the enter key. If the results come back with more than one page then a pagination component will render at the top and bottom of the results.

#Enjoy!


<!-- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
